Clone the following repo: `git@github.com:javflores/your-trainline-graphql-server.git`
After cloning the repo, switch to `01-start`

To achieve this, open your terminal\shell and navigate to a directory where you want to place the repo. Then use:

```
git clone git@github.com:javflores/your-trainline-graphql-server.git
cd your-trainline-graphql-server
git checkout 01-start
```

## Verification

At this point the graphql-with-tdd folder should only contain a .gitignore file and the .git folder.

```
$ ls -al
./
../
.git/
.gitignore
```

If you don't have this, please ask for help...
