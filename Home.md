# Welcome to the **Your first trainline graphQl**!

There are many theoretical talks about GraphQL out there. They show principles and ideas and while they are really good to Gain some understanding, I believe the best way to learn is to practice. In this workshop youâ€™ll get your hands dirty. 

We will start by creating a fully functional GraphQL server that delivers live train times departures. We will work our way from leveraging dummy data through implementing the full api with its different resolvers and types. 
Once our api is ready we will plug it to a real React app and make it render the live departures data.
Next we'll explore subscription: the brand new operation where we will get the server to push real time live departures to the client side.

We will use [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) in this workshop, but the main principles of GraphQL apply to other technologies.

Along the way we will explain the principles behind GraphQL and why this technology is awesome.
