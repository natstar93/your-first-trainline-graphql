# Welcome to the **Your first trainline graphQl**!

First off thanks for coming along to this workshop. I'll do my best to have you having a great time and learn something new.

There are many theoretical talks about GraphQL out there. They show principles and ideas and, while they are really good to gain some understanding, I believe the best way to learn is to practice. In this workshop youâ€™ll get your hands dirty. 

- We will start by creating a fully functional GraphQL server that delivers live train times departures. We will work our way from leveraging dummy data through implementing the full api with its different resolvers and types. 

- Once our api is ready we will plug it to a web app and make it render the live departures data.

- Finally we'll explore subscription to create a real time live departures app. Subscriptions are the brand new type of operation in GraphQL. We will get the server pushing real time data to the client.

Along the way we will explain the principles behind GraphQL and why this technology is awesome.

In this workshop we will use [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com), but the main principles of GraphQL apply to other technologies.
