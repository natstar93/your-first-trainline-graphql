# Welcome to the **Your first trainline graphQl**!

There are many theoretical talks about GraphQL out there. They show principles and ideas and while they are really good to Gain some understanding, I believe the best way to learn is to practice. In this workshop youâ€™ll get your hands dirty. 

We will start by creating a fully functional GraphQL server that delivers live train times departures. We will work our way from leveraging dummy data through implementing the full api with its different resolvers and types. 
Once our api is ready we will plug it to a real React app and make it render the live departures data.
Next we'll deal with mutations. We will use them to store the searches of live departures carried through our User interface.

We will use [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) in this workshop, but the main principles of GraphQL apply to other technologies.

Along the way we will explain the principles behind GraphQL and why this technology is awesome.
