# Welcome to the your-trainline-graphql-server wiki!

In this workshop we will introduce GraphQL. We will start with the basics and work our way towards implementing a fully functional GraphQL server.
We will create a "Backend for the frontend" app that will deliver real time departures data for our Frontend apps.
We will consume our real-time API, https://realtime.thetrainline.com/departures/wat
We will use Apollo Server in this workshop, but the main principles of GraphQL apply to other technologies.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- Git installed
- Node installed, we recommend version 8 or higher
$ node --version
- Yarn is recommended as it will accelerate the install of any packages.
